Structure of the Clean Architecture

Layer 1
DOMAIN should be an independent project.
It encapsulates all the business logic and entities that define the core functionality of the system

Layer 2
APPLICATION layer should depend on the DOMAIN layer
Acts as a mediator.

Layer 3
INFRASTRUCTURE layer should depend on both the APPLICATION and DOMAIN layers
The Infrastructure layer is responsible for managing external dependencies such as databases, web services, and other frameworks
This layer is often referred to as the “technical glue” of Clean Architecture, as it connects all the other layers together

For adding Database connection, since this layer is incharge of all database related stuffs
-- If using Entity Framework, and Postgres, install the following packages
--Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL -- translate classes in Migration files to database schema
--Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools -- for command line interactions
--

Layer 4
WEB API (Presentation or UI) layer should depend on only the INFRASTRUCTURE and APPLICATION layers


Recommendations
When combining the CQRS pattern and MediatR

1. Install MediatR, FluentValidation, FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions package in the Application Layer
2. Install Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection in the Infrastructure layer
3. Install MediatR.Extensions.DependencyInjection in the Web API

If using AutoMapper for Mapping Types
1. Install AutoMapper, AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection in the Application Layer

For Respository Pattern or Data interactions
1. The DbContext exist in the Infrastructure Layer
    Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore and (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer-- For SQL or Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL)
Repository interfaces are created at the Application Layer, while their implementations are made at the infrastructure layer
( Remember to register all created repositories )
All migrations are run at the infrastructure layer

When implementing the MediatR Pattern using Commands and Queries

OPTION 1

For each domain feature, a folder needs to exist eg Person folder should contain a Command and Queries Folder,
each of which could probably contain some, but not all of the below mentioned

 >> Command - They represent the intent to perform specific actions
-- Command for the WRITE action to be performed  eg CreatePersonCommand (must)
-- CommandHandler to handle the  respective command  eg CreatePersonCommandHandler (must)
-- Command Response (optional, depending on use case)
-- Command Validator (optional, for performing validations)

 >> Queries - These queries represent the intent to read data
 -- Query for READ action to perform eg GetAPersonQuery
 -- Query Handler to handle the corresponding query action eg GetAPersonQueryHandler
    ...

OPTION 2
Or you can choose to keep a seperate folder for CommandHandlers And Query CommandHandlers
ie 
For a feature, say Person, you create 
- A Command folder that holds all the Write commands pertaining to the Person
- A Queries folder that holds all  Read commands pertaining to that feature
- A Command Handler folder for handling all commads
- A Query Handler folder for handling all queries

Command or Query must implement the IRequest<> interface from MediatR,
while the corresponding handler, must implement the IRequestHandler<Command or Query, Return Type supplied in the Command or Query> interface  
and must implement the Handle method of the interface
